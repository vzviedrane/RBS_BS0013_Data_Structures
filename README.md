# BS0013 Data Structures

Public student materials for **BS0013 Data Structures** at Riga Business School, Riga Technical University.

## Course materials

- `syllabus/` — overall course syllabus;
- `lectures/` — weekly lecture materials as released;
- `quizzes/` — student self-check materials where published;
- `labs/week01/` — Week 1 practical;
- `labs/week02/` — Week 2 practical;
- `labs/week03/` — Week 3 dynamic-array practical;
- `labs/week04/` — Week 4 linked-structures practical.

## Use GitHub Codespaces

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Select **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main** in your fork.
3. Wait for the terminal to report `BS0013 environment ready.`
4. Weekly practicals are self-contained under `labs/weekNN/`.

The root development container provides Ubuntu, GCC, GDB, CMake, Git, and C++20 tooling for the course.

## Keep your fork up to date

Before starting a new week, commit any work you want to keep:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Save work before course update"
```

If there is nothing to commit, Git will simply report that the working tree is clean.

Your fork normally has `origin` pointing to your own GitHub repository. Add the official course repository as `upstream` **once**:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ValRCS/RBS_BS0013_Data_Structures.git
```

If `upstream` is already listed by `git remote -v`, do not add it again.

To bring newly released course material into your fork while preserving your commits:

```bash
git switch main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

A normal weekly update should merge cleanly because new material is usually added in new week folders. If Git reports a merge conflict, inspect `git status` and resolve the conflict before continuing; do not discard your previous lab work merely to obtain the update.

## Current practical: Week 4

After synchronizing your fork:

```bash
cd labs/week04
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

Then read `labs/week04/instructions.md` and `labs/week04/assignment.md`.

The starter compiles before the TODOs are completed. When your implementation is ready, run:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
bash scripts/check-week04.sh
```

The Week 4 verification script also runs the public tests with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer enabled.

Instructor notes, solutions, answer keys, private tests, and assessment rationale are maintained separately and are not part of this public repository.
